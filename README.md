## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (Node.js)
- **APIs**: Spotify Web API, Spotify Web Playback SDK
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## Prerequisites

- Spotify Premium account (required for Web Playback SDK)
- Node.js and npm installed locally
- Netlify CLI (optional, for local development)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spotify-xm
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Add redirect URI: `https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/spotify-auth-callback`
4. Note your Client ID and Client Secret

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
URL=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
```

For local development, use:
```env
URL=http://localhost:8888
```

### 5. Build Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will watch for changes in `src/input.css` and generate `src/output.css`.

### 6. Deploy to Netlify

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

Don't forget to set the environment variables in Netlify's dashboard.

## Local Development

```bash
# Run Netlify dev server
netlify dev

# In another terminal, run Tailwind CSS watcher
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8888` to see the app.

## Testing

### Validate Playlist Functionality

Run the test script to ensure everything is configured correctly:

```bash
node test/test-playlist.js
```

This will verify:
- Playlist ID extraction from various URL formats
- Station configuration is correct
- All required methods are implemented
- Your 90s playlist is properly configured

### Test Playlist ID Extraction

You can also test the playlist ID extraction utility directly:

```bash
node utils/extract-playlist-id.js "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/YOUR_PLAYLIST_URL"
```

## Code Improvements & Refactoring

### Major Refactoring Done

1. **Separated JavaScript from HTML**
   - Moved all inline JavaScript to `src/spotify-player.js`
   - Created a proper class-based architecture with `SpotifyPlayer`

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error handling for all API calls
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Added user-friendly error notifications
   - Handle rate limiting gracefully

3. **Fixed Memory Leaks**
   - Properly cleanup intervals on page unload
   - Clear intervals when switching states
   - Added visibility change handling to pause updates when tab is hidden

4. **Implemented Token Refresh**
   - Created a new Netlify function for token refresh
   - Automatic token refresh before expiry
   - Seamless re-authentication when tokens expire

5. **Added Caching**
   - Cache liked songs for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies

6. **Improved Edge Cases**
   - Handle users with no liked songs
   - Properly detect track endings
   - Prevent duplicate track ending handlers
   - Handle missing album artwork gracefully

7. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Added loading states with visual feedback
   - Toast notifications for errors and info
   - Smooth transitions and animations
   - Responsive design fixes
   - Added hover states and cursor pointers

8. **Code Organization**
   - Centralized configuration with `CONFIG` object
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Added comprehensive comments

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **No Liked Songs**: Shows helpful error message directing users to like songs first
2. **Network Failures**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respects Spotify's rate limits and retries after specified time
4. **Missing Images**: Falls back to placeholder image when album art fails to load
5. **Token Expiry**: Automatic refresh before expiry with fallback to re-authentication
6. **Tab Visibility**: Pauses updates when tab is hidden to save resources
7. **Device Disconnection**: Handles device going offline gracefully
8. **Multiple Initializations**: Prevents duplicate initialization attempts
9. **Browser Compatibility**: Checks for MediaSession API support before using

## Adding New Stations

### Playlist-Based Stations

To add a new playlist-based station:

1. **Get the Playlist ID**: 
   - From a Spotify playlist URL like `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5nCCpeCobBAoF91TwgQetX?si=...`
   - The playlist ID is: `5nCCpeCobBAoF91TwgQetX`

2. **Update the Station Configuration**:
   Edit `src/spotify-player.js` and find the `STATIONS` array:

   ```javascript
   { 
     id: 'my-station-id', 
     name: 'My Station Name', 
     description: 'Station description', 
     image: 'placeholder.jpg', // Fallback only - playlist cover will be used
     type: 'playlist',
     playlistId: 'YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID_HERE'
   }
   ```

3. **Cover Images**: 
   - The app will automatically fetch and display the playlist's cover art
   - The `image` field serves as a fallback if the playlist has no cover
   - No need to create custom station images for playlist-based stations

### Example: Adding a 2000s Station

```javascript
{ 
  id: '2k', 
  name: 'Y2K Hits', 
  description: 'Pop from the 2000s', 
  image: 'stations/station-2k.png',
  type: 'playlist',
  playlistId: 'YOUR_2000s_PLAYLIST_ID'
}
```

### Station Types

- **`liked`**: Special type for user's liked songs
- **`playlist`**: Spotify playlist-based station
- **`podcast`**: Reserved for future podcast support

## Architecture

### Station Management

The application uses a flexible station system:

1. **Station Configuration**: All stations are defined in the `STATIONS` array
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Tracks are fetched from Spotify API based on station type
3. **Dynamic Cover Art**: Playlist cover images are automatically fetched and displayed
4. **Caching**: Playlist tracks and metadata are cached to reduce API calls
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing playlists, unavailable tracks, or missing cover images

### Playback Flow

1. User selects a station
2. System determines station type (liked/playlist)
3. For playlists: Fetches playlist metadata and updates cover image
4. Fetches tracks from appropriate source
5. Plays random track at random position
6. Automatically queues next track when current ends

### Dynamic Cover Images

- **Automatic**: Playlist-based stations automatically display the actual playlist cover art
- **Cached**: Cover images and metadata are cached for 30 minutes
- **Fallback**: If a playlist has no cover or fails to load, the original station image is kept
- **Loading States**: Subtle visual feedback while images are being fetched
- **Performance**: Images are preloaded in the background when the app starts

## Features Not Yet Implemented

- Other station types (Oldies, 70s, 80s, 2K, etc.) - add playlist IDs to enable
- Playlist creation from played songs
- Search functionality
- User preferences storage
- Volume control UI
- Seek bar interaction
- Custom user playlists as stations

## Known Limitations

- Requires Spotify Premium account for playback
- Web Playback SDK may not work in all browsers (best in Chrome/Edge)
- Limited to 50 liked songs per fetch (can be extended)
