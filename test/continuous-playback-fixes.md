# Continuous Playback Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
From the logs, the continuous playback was failing because:
1. The same track was being selected again ("Baby, I Love Your Way / Freebird")
2. When the track ended, it reset to position 0 and paused
3. No new track was actually played, just the same track loaded but paused

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Smart Track Selection
- **Problem**: Same track was being selected repeatedly
- **Solution**: 
  - Track last 5 recently played URIs
  - Avoid selecting the same track consecutively
  - Filter out recently played tracks when possible
  - Added logging to show track selection avoiding repeats

### 2. Playback Verification
- **Problem**: Track would load but not actually start playing
- **Solution**:
  - After sending play command, wait 500ms and verify playback started
  - If track is paused, automatically resume
  - Retry playback up to 3 times if it fails
  - Explicit `position_ms: 0` in play command

### 3. Enhanced Track End Detection
- **Problem**: Position reset to 0 wasn't being detected as track end
- **Solution**:
  - Detect when position was near end (>90%) then suddenly < 1 second
  - Added `atBeginningPaused` condition to catch reset scenarios
  - Monitor now checks for position < 500ms while paused after being > 80%

### 4. Continuous Playback Monitor
- **Problem**: State changes weren't always firing at track end
- **Solution**:
  - Monitor runs every 2 seconds as failsafe
  - Special case detection for paused at position 0
  - Checks if previous position was > 10 seconds or > 80% of duration

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Track Selection**:
   ```
   Selected track: New Song by Artist (avoiding 4 recent tracks)
   ```

2. **Playback Start**:
   ```
   Attempting to play track: spotify:track:xxx (attempt 1)
   Track playback started successfully
   ```

3. **Track End Detection**:
   ```
   Track reset detected - was at end, now at beginning and paused
   === TRACK ENDING - Starting next track ===
   ```

4. **Continuous Flow**:
   - Different track selected each time
   - Playback verified before proceeding
   - Multiple detection methods ensure reliability

## Testing the Fix

To verify continuous playback is working:

```javascript
// Skip to near end of current track
const state = await window.__spotifyPlayer.player.getCurrentState();
if (state) {
  const nearEnd = state.duration - 10000; // 10 seconds before end
  await window.__spotifyPlayer.seekToPosition(nearEnd);
}

// Watch console for:
// 1. Track selection avoiding recent tracks
// 2. Playback verification messages
// 3. Proper track advancement
```

## Debugging Commands

```javascript
// Check recently played tracks
window.__spotifyPlayer.recentlyPlayedUris

// Check last played track
window.__spotifyPlayer.lastPlayedTrackUri

// Manual trigger if needed
window.__spotifyPlayer.handleTrackEnding()

// Reset if stuck
window.__spotifyPlayer.trackEndingProcessed = false
window.__spotifyPlayer.recentlyPlayedUris = []
```
